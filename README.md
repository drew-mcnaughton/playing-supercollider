# playing-supercollider
Files generated by playing with the sound synthesiser software Supercollider.

I had the thought that I could learn Supercollider and how to use git at the same time.
So this repository is going to be where I store my Supercollider files while I'm getting to know how to use it better.
Feel free to have a look and I'll put notes in as well (no pun intended).
